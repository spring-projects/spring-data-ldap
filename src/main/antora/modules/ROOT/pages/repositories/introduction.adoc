This chapter explains the basic foundations of Spring Data repositories and LDAP specifics.
Before continuing to the LDAP specifics, make sure you have a sound understanding of the basic concepts explained in xref:repositories/core-concepts.adoc[Working with Spring Data Repositories].

The goal of the Spring Data repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various persistence stores.
