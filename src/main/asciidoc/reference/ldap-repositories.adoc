= LDAP Repositories

This chapter points out the specialties for repository support for LDAP. It builds on the core repository support explained in <<repositories>>. You should have a sound understanding of the basic concepts explained there.

You should keep in mind the following points as you work with Spring LDAP repositories:

*  Spring LDAP repositories can be enabled by using a `<data-ldap:repositories>` tag in your XML configuration or by using an `@EnableLdapRepositories` annotation on a configuration class.
*  To include support for `LdapQuery` parameters in automatically generated repositories, have your interface extend `LdapRepository` rather than `CrudRepository`.
*  All Spring LDAP repositories must work with entities annotated with the ODM annotations, as described in https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/{springLdapVersion}/reference/#odm[Object-Directory Mapping].
*  Since all ODM managed classes must have a Distinguished Name as the ID, all Spring LDAP repositories must have the ID type parameter set to `javax.naming.Name`.
   Indeed, the built-in `LdapRepository` only takes one type parameter: the managed entity class, which defaults the ID to `javax.naming.Name`.
*  Due to specifics of the LDAP protocol, paging and sorting are not supported for Spring LDAP repositories.

NOTE: You must use ODM annotations, such as `org.springframework.ldap.odm.annotations.Id`. Using Spring Data's annotation does not work, because Spring LDAP uses its own mapping layer.

[[ldap.repo-usage]]
== Usage

To access domain entities stored in a LDAP-compliant directory, you can use our sophisticated repository support that significantly eases implementation. To do so, create an interface for your repository, as the following example shows:

.Sample Person entity
====
[source,java]
----
@Entry(objectClasses = { "person", "top" }, base="ou=someOu")
public class Person {

   @Id
   private Name dn;

   @Attribute(name="cn")
   @DnAttribute(value="cn", index=1)
   private String fullName;

   @Attribute(name="firstName")
   private String firstName;

   // No @Attribute annotation means this is bound to the LDAP attribute
   // with the same value
   private String firstName;

   @DnAttribute(value="ou", index=0)
   @Transient
   private String company;

   @Transient
   private String someUnmappedField;
   // ...more attributes below
}
----
====

We have a simple domain object here. Note that it has a property named `dn` of type `Name`. With that domain object, we can create a repository to persist objects of that type by defining an interface for it, as follows:

.Basic repository interface to persist `Person` entities
====
[source]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  // additional custom finder methods go here
}
----
====

Right now, this interface serves only typing purposes, but we can add additional methods to it later. In your Spring configuration, add the following:

.General LDAP repository Spring configuration
====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
@Configuration
@EnableLdapRepositories("com.acme.*.repositories")
class MyConfig {

  @Bean
  ContextSource contextSource() {

    LdapContextSource ldapContextSource = new LdapContextSource();

    ldapContextSource.setUserDn("cn=Admin");
    ldapContextSource.setPassword("secret");
    ldapContextSource.setUrl("ldap://127.0.0.1:389");

    return ldapContextSource;
  }

  @Bean
  LdapTemplate ldapTemplate(ContextSource contextSource) {
    return new LdapTemplate(contextSource);
  }
}
----

.XML
[source,xml,role="secondary"]
----

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:ldap="http://www.springframework.org/schema/ldap"
  xmlns:data-ldap="http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/ldap"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/ldap
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/ldap/spring-ldap.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/ldap
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/data/ldap/spring-ldap.xsd">

  <ldap:context-source url="ldap://127.0.0.1:389"
                     username="cn=Admin"
                     password="secret" />

  <ldap:ldap-template />

  <data-ldap:repositories base-package="com.acme.*.repositories" />

</beans>
----
====

This configuration causes the base packages to be scanned for interfaces that extend `LdapRepository` and create Spring beans for each one found.
By default, the repositories get an autowired `LdapTemplate` Spring bean that is called `ldapTemplate`, so you only need to configure `ldap-template-ref` explicitly if you deviate from this convention.

If you want to go with Java configuration, use the `@EnableLdapRepositories` annotation. The annotation carries the same attributes as the namespace element. If no base package is configured, the infrastructure scans the package of the annotated configuration class.

Because our domain repository extends `CrudRepository`, it provides you with CRUD operations as well as methods for access to the entities. Working with the repository instance is a matter of dependency injecting it into a client.

We can add paging access to our repository, as follows:

.Paging access to Person entities
====
[source,java]
----
@ExtendWith({SpringExtension.class})
@ContextConfiguration
class PersonRepositoryTests {

    @Autowired PersonRepository repository;

    @Test
    void readAll() {

      List<Person> persons = repository.findAll();
      assertThat(persons.isEmpty(), is(false));
    }
}
----
====

The sample creates an application context with Spring's unit test support, which will perform annotation-based dependency injection into test cases. Inside the test method, we  use the repository to query the datastore.

[[ldap.repositories.queries]]
== Query Methods

Most of the data access operations you usually trigger on a repository result in a query being run against the LDAP directory. Defining such a query is a matter of declaring a method on the repository interface, as the following example shows:

.PersonRepository with query methods
====
[source,java]
----
interface PersonRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository<Person, String> {

    List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);                            <1>

    List<Person> findByLastnameFirstname(String lastname, String firstname); <2>
}
----
<1> The method shows a query for all people with the given `lastname`. The query is derived by parsing the method name for constraints that can be concatenated with `And` and `Or`. Thus, the method name results in a query expression of `(&(objectclass=person)(lastname=lastname))`.
<2> The method shows a query for all people with the given `lastname` and `firstname`. The query is derived by parsing the method name. Thus, the method name results in a query expression of `(&(objectclass=person)(lastname=lastname)(firstname=firstname))`.
====

The following table provides samples of the keywords that you can use with query methods:

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
.Supported keywords for query methods
|===
| Keyword
| Sample
| Logical result

| `LessThanEqual`
| `findByAgeLessThanEqual(int age)`
| `(attribute<=age)`

| `GreaterThanEqual`
| `findByAgeGreaterThanEqual(int age)`
| `(attribute>=age)`

| `IsNotNull`, `NotNull`
| `findByFirstnameNotNull()`
| `(firstname=*)`

| `IsNull`, `Null`
| `findByFirstnameNull()`
| `(!(firstname=*))`

| `Like`
| `findByFirstnameLike(String name)`
| `(firstname=name)`

| `NotLike`, `IsNotLike`
| `findByFirstnameNotLike(String name)`
| `(!(firstname=name*))`

| `StartingWith`
| `findByStartingWith(String name)`
| `(firstname=name*)`

| `EndingWith`
| `findByFirstnameLike(String name)`
| `(firstname=*name)`

| `Containing`
| `findByFirstnameLike(String name)`
| `(firstname=\*name*)`

| `(No keyword)`
| `findByFirstname(String name)`
| `(Firstname=name)`

| `Not`
| `findByFirstnameNot(String name)`
| `(!(Firstname=name))`

=== QueryDSL Support
Basic QueryDSL support is included in Spring LDAP. This support includes the following:

*  An Annotation Processor, `LdapAnnotationProcessor`, for generating QueryDSL classes based on Spring LDAP ODM annotations. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/{springLdapVersion}/reference/#odm[Object-Directory Mapping] for more information on the ODM annotations.
*  A Query implementation, `QueryDslLdapQuery`, for building and running QueryDSL queries in code.
*  Spring Data repository support for QueryDSL predicates. `QueryDslPredicateExecutor` includes a number of additional methods with appropriate parameters. You can extend this interface (along with `LdapRepository`) to include this support in your repository.

== Miscellaneous

[[ldap.repositories.misc.cdi-integration]]
=== CDI Integration

Instances of the repository interfaces are usually created by a container, for which Spring is the most natural choice when working with Spring Data. As of version 2.1, Spring Data LDAP includes a custom CDI extension that lets you use the repository abstraction in CDI environments. The extension is part of the JAR. To activate it, drop the Spring Data LDAP JAR into your classpath. You can now set up the infrastructure by implementing a CDI Producer for the `LdapTemplate`, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
class LdapTemplateProducer {

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    public LdapOperations createLdapTemplate() {

        ContextSource contextSource = …
        return new LdapTemplate(contextSource);
    }
}
----

The Spring Data LDAP CDI extension picks up the `LdapTemplate` as a CDI bean and creates a proxy for a Spring Data repository whenever a bean of a repository type is requested by the container. Thus, obtaining an instance of a Spring Data repository is a matter of declaring an injected property, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
class RepositoryClient {

  @Inject
  PersonRepository repository;

  public void businessMethod() {
    List<Person> people = repository.findAll();
  }
}
----
